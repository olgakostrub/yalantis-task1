# yalantis-task1
First practical task for Yalantis summer internship

UI mistakes that I found. 
1. Orange status label is below the category name (occupies too much space).
Fix: move it to the same line with the category name.
2. Height of description lines is different on some reason.
Fix: make height (margin/padding) the same for all description lines
3. Image container goes over the screen (looks not good).
Fix: make horizontal recycler view fit the space remaining to the screen bottom if possible.
4. Two different languages are used (Russian and Ukrainian).
Fix: use only Ukrainian language (and Russian only in localization; however, Russian localization was not included in the task).
